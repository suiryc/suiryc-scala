# 3rd-party base configuration

# This file is embedded in generated jars and must only contain sensible default
# values for 3rd-party (e.g. akka) configuration elements.
# It is called "application-override" and include "application" because some
# libraries/framework use "application.conf" instead of "reference.conf". In
# order to work it must be included from the actual application configuration
# file, or at worst be used as default application.conf ("config.resource"/...
# system property).
# Reference configuration is in the standard reference.conf.
